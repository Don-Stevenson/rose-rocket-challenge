### Things I am really proud of!
- I learned to use a ton of new libraries! e.g. react-calendar-timeline, moment, date-fns, react-json-to-csv, semantic-ui, etc.
- Using a reducer to handle the state  
- I chose to handle real dates and display them in a calendar. This was really tough, and I am really pleased that I was able to work and use actual dates.
- Getting a server up and running that persists data!
- Tackling a full stack project for the first time by myself with minimal
- Getting some styling done with the react-calendar-timeline!
- Getting a sense of accomplishment and joy for what I was able to complete in a week!!!


### If I had more time (in no particular order) ...
- hook up the logic for the drivers drop down to display the tasks in the calendar / task cards for the selected driver
- impliment the logic in the createDriverCSV helper to render the CSV file for the selected driver
- Refactor, Refactor, Refactor!
- spend more time on the styling and design, especially for mobile
- Make / Import more helper functions to clean up the code further
- add maps to the destinations for dispatchers or drivers
- take in drivers phone numbers and send out addresses and maps via twillio or other sms service
- handled click and drag tasks in the calendar that auto updates the task times

### Bugs
- Bowser may require a resize before the calendar renders the individual tasks
- react calender seems extra finicky with scolling and resizing, would have liked to have solved that

### Rose Rocket Front End Looks like
[Front End Picture here](github link here)


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
